## Presentation and Demonstration (60%)

### Presentation

Presentation time: 10 min

* PPT presentation < 7 minutes including a short demo video.
* Q& A for 3 minutes

### Demonstration

We will have the demonstration time after all the presentations.

Create a test scenario and show it as a demonstration.

We will invite guests to the demonstration.

## Report (40%)

The file name should be **Project2\_YourProjectKeyword\_YourName.md**

Create a **github repository** and upload all the source code and report documentation.

The lab report must be written in a '**Tutorial**' format to explain the whole process from A to Z in detail.

Your report will be posted on the class website and be open to the public.

You can refer to example reports
