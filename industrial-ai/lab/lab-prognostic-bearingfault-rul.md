# LAB: Prognostic BearingFault RUL

## LAB: Bearing Fault Monitoring and RUL Estimation

Industrial AI & Automation 2023

**Name:**

**Date:**

***

## Introduction

In this LAB, you are required to create a simple code for (1) Fault Monitoring and (2) RUL estimation

> You can refer to RUL estimation tutorial codes and related papers

#### Fault Monitoring

* Detect Fault Status
* Display WARNING MESSAGE (OK, Warning, Damaged)

#### RUL Estimation

* Estimate RUL similarly to Tutorial codes (CaseStudy 3, 4)
* The End of Life can be assumed when the repair is conducted

**An Example Process**

### Dataset

Raw Dataset of Bearing Velocity measured that shows a Bearing Life cycle before the repair is done. Also the velocity measurement after the repair is provided.

Using the given dataset, develop a simple program for

* Bearing velocity measured 24 times per day
* Each measurement is L=8192 with Fs=2560Hz
* Measurement for consecutive days until repair is done

### Report

The file name should be **LAB\_Bearing\_RUL\_Prognosis\_YourName.**\* // for main src and report

Submit the report either

(Option 1) \*.mlx & mat files (Recommended)

(Option 2) or \*.md and \*.mat files. When writing a report in \*.md format, you have to embed the code snippets as done in \*.mlx file.

Also, submit **LAB\_Bearing\_RUL\_Prognosis\_YourName.pdf** file.
