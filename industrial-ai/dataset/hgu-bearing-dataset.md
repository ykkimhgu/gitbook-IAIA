# HGU Bearing Dataset

## Description

This is a small-sized dataset of ball bearing accelerations for normal and faulty bearings.

Experiments were conducted on the lab-manufactured testbench using a 1.4kW Electric motor.

The test bench for motor performance assessment consists of:

* AC Servo Motor with 1.4 kW (HG-KR43J)
* Gearbox 1:100
* Gearbox 50:1
* Torque transducer (UTM2-10Nm)
* Accelerometer (PCB-(M)352C66)

### Bearing Faults

The test bearings support the motor shaft. Defects were introduced at a single point by EDM machining. The diameters of defects in millimeters:

* **Inner, outer race fault size**:
  * diameter 1 mm / depth 2.3 mm
* **Ball fault size**:
  * diameter 1 mm / depth 1 mm

**Bearing Info:**

* D1 = 37.05
* D2 = 24.95
* N\_B = 13
* Beta = 6.05

### Other Faults

The testbench can also apply shaft misalignment faults and load imbalance faults

* **Misalignment Fault:**
  * Aligned
  * Misaligned: 1mm, 2mm
* **Imbalance Fault:**
  * Balanced disk
  * Imbalanced disk

## Dataset File

**Dataset download**: [HGU\_bearing\_dataset\_v1.mat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bkB45JlS0Z7lILDIBCOj2u4NZzHTqn9i/view?usp=share_link)

\*\*\*\*Data was collected for normal bearings, defect bearing, and defect bearing with misalignment. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 12,000 samples/second for 10 seconds. Data files are in **Matlab** format.

This dataset corresponds to the following conditions:

* Aligned shaft / Misaligned shaft
* Shaft rotating speed of 500 rpm
* 12 kHz sampling frequency of the accelerometers

###

### Fault Class

The bearing health conditions are classified as follows:

| Fault type       | Aligned shaft | Misaligned shaft |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Normal           | N1            | N2               |
| Inner race fault | I1            | I2               |
| Outer race fault | O1            | O2               |
| Ball fault       | B1            | B2               |

Each data sample was obtained using a window with a size of 12000 and 1000 strides for data augmentation.

**bearing\_acc**

* raw acceleration data captured for 10 secs

**trainset**

* train data : 87\*8=696 datasets

**testset**

* test data: 21\*8=168 datasets

A total of 108 data samples were obtained for each class, and the ratio of train/test dataset was set to 8:2 for validation.

* 87 train datasets and 21 test datasets were obtained from randomly 108 data samples for each class.

| Class | Train samples | Test samples |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------ |
| N1    | 87            | 21           |
| N2    | 87            | 21           |
| I1    | 87            | 21           |
| I2    | 87            | 21           |
| O1    | 87            | 21           |
| O2    | 87            | 21           |
| B1    | 87            | 21           |
| B2    | 87            | 21           |
| Sum   | 696           | 168          |
