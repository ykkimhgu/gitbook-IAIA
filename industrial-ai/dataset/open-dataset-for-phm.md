## Open Dataset for Bearing

* CWRU Dataset
* Paderborn Dataset
* FEMTO Dataset
* MFPT Dataset
* IMS Dataset

### CWRU BEARING DATASET

[Site Link](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file)

Type: Bearing Diagnosis

Ball bearing test data for normal and faulty bearings. Experiments were conducted using a 2 hp Reliance Electric motor, and acceleration data was measured at locations near to and remote from the motor bearings

### Paderborn University Dataset

[Site Link](https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/datacenter/bearing-datacenter/)

Type: Bearing Diagnosis / Prognostic

This dataset \[44] is also for bearing fault diagnosis and is provided by the KAT datacenter in Paderborn University. The essential components of the test rig are a drive motor, a torque measurement shaft, a test module and a load motor.

* Out of the 26 damaged bearing sets, 12 were articially damaged, and 14 were damaged using accelerated life tests to simulate real damage
* Real defects are generated through aging and the gradual loss of lubrication

### FEMTO Dataset

[Site Link](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) [Download](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/18/)

Type: Bearing Diagnosis / Prognostic

FEMTO dataset \[49], \[50] is provided by FEMTO-ST Institute,Besancon, France. The real experiments on bearing's accelerated life tests, which are generated using an experimental platform called PRONOSTIA, are provided in this dataset. PRONOSTIA is an experimentation platform dedicated to test and validate bearings fault detection, diagnostic and prognostic approaches.

### MFPT Dataset

[Site Link](https://www.mfpt.org/fault-data-sets/)

Type: Bearing Diagnosis / Prognostic

MFPT dataset \[57], which is provided by the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology.

Provide various datasets of known good and faulted conditions for both bearings and gears.

* The dataset comprises data from a bearing test rig (nominal bearing data, an outer race fault at various loads, and inner race fault and various loads), and three real-world faults.

### IMS Dataset

[Site Link](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) [Download](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/3/)

Type: Bearing Prognostic

Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), University of Cincinnati

## Other PHM Open Dataset

### NASA PHM dataset: PCoE Datasets

[Site Link](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/)

The Prognostics Data Repository is a collection of data sets that have been donated by various universities, agencies, or companies. The data repository focuses exclusively on prognostic data sets, i.e., data sets that can be used for development of prognostic algorithms

### BLDC MOTOR TEMPERATURE

[Site Link](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/bldc-motor-temperature)

This dataset was prepared to estimate the winding temperature of a BLDC motor for a variable load and speed profile. It contains two files. The first one is the measurement results for the motor without cooling, while the second one is the measurement results after installing an additional cooling fan on the shaft. The data included in the files are time stamp, winding temperature, casing temperature, speed, current, power loss, mean and standard deviation of the measured quantities for 14400 data records.

### EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE FOR DETECTING AND DIAGNOSING ROTOR BROKEN BAR IN A THREE-PHASE INDUCTION MOTOR.

[Site Link](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/experimental-database-detecting-and-diagnosing-rotor-broken-bar-three-phase-induction)

The data set contains electrical and mechanical signals from experiments on three-phase induction motors. The experimental tests were carried out for different mechanical loads on the induction motor axis and different severities of broken bar defects in the motor rotor, including data regarding the rotor without defects. Ten repetitions were performed for each experimental condition.

## Data Challenge List

### IEEE PHM CHALLENGE COMPETITION 2009: CWRU

[Site Link](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/cwru-bearing-dataset-and-gearbox-dataset-ieee-phm-challenge-competition-2009) The bearing dataset is acquired by the electrical engineering laboratory of Case Western Reserve University and published on the Bearing Data Center Website. The gearbox dataset is from IEEE PHM Challenge Competition in 2009

### PHM 2008 Challenge Dataset: Nasa Turbofan Dataset

[Site Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predictive-maintenance/data)

The dataset consists of different multivariate time-series. These different time-series refers to different engine ('engine\_no' in the dataset). The sampling of the time series is 1 point per engine cycle ('time\_in\_cycles' in the dataset).
