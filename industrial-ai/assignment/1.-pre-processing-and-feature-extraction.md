Download small CWRU Dataset

* CWRU\_small\_rawData\_FeatureExtraction\_Assignment.zip ([**download here**](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/HGU_IAIA/tree/main/Dataset))

## Dataset

**Sampling:** Drive end bearing(12K): 12,000 samples/second

**Classes:** Normal / Outer Race fault / Inner Race fault Each under 1HP load, fault diameter of 0.007inches

**Variables** DE - drive end accelerometer data FE - fan end accelerometer data BA - base accelerometer data time - time series data RPM - shaft rpm during testing

## Extract and Analyze Features

* Extract Time-Domain Features
* Mean, Std, Skewness, Kurtosis, Peak2Peak, RMS, CrestFactor, ShapeFactor, ImpulseFactor, MarginFactor, Energy etc
* Extract Frequency-Domain Features
* Basic features, SKMean, SKStd, SKSkewness, SKKurtosis, etc
* Envelop Extraction
* Plot STFT
* Plot Kurtogram
* Plot Spectral Kurtosis

## Analyze and Compare Features
