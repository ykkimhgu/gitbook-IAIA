# 3. CWRU Diagnostics

## Introduction

This assignment is implementing 'Feature Extraction' Section in the following journal paper

Diagnostics 101: A Tutorial for Fault Diagnostics of Rolling Element Bearing Using Envelope Analysis in MATLAB \[Matlab code]: https://www.kau-sdol.com/matlab-code

Follow Section 5 of the journal paper. Create your own code to analyze the CWRU dataset as instructed in the Section 5 of the paper.

Features should include

* Time-Domain Features: Mean, Std, Skewness, Kurtosis, Peak2Peak, RMS, CrestFactor, ShapeFactor, ImpulseFactor, MarginFactor, Energy
* Frequency-Domain Feature: basic features, SKMean, SKStd, SKSkewness, SKKurtosis

### Preparation
